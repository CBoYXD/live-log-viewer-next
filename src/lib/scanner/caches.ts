/**
 * Module-level caches must survive Next.js dev hot-reload, so they hang off
 * `globalThis`. Every scanner module gets its named Map through this helper.
 *
 * Invalidation conventions (same as the Python prototype):
 *  - size-keyed: value stored as [size, payload]; recompute when size differs;
 *  - mtime-keyed: for small JSON sidecar files;
 *  - append-only: needle scans remember how many bytes of each file were
 *    already searched and only scan the appended suffix.
